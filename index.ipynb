So, to combat this problem, there is a method we can implement on our dataframe object called `fillna()`. It takes an argument, which is the value we would like to insert anywhere there is information missing from our dataframe. Use this method to fill any places in our dataframe that are missing values (i.e. `False` or `0`). This ensure that if we are attempting to operate on this data, we are always able to keep our data consistent and be sure the datatype we are operating on."

    "Great work! In this lab, we practiced reading data from a csv file using the Pandas library. Remember to adhere to convention where it makes sense, like using a library or working on a codebase with other programmers. We also looked at using Pandas to fill in any blank values (`NaN`) in our data to make sure we would have consistent and easier data to work with, as well as guard against any bugs in our code. We then used pandas to format our data into a list of dictionaries so that we could more easily operate on it."
